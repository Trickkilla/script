Greetings,
 
​​​​​​​Thank you for contacting Bethesda Customer Support about the issue you're experiencing.

If you are experiencing difficulty progressing through this mission, make sure to check out our New Player Guide, which offers tips and tricks as well as guides for many aspects of Starfield.

Sometimes because of the depth and complexity of our games, you may encounter a temporary issue that can be easily resolved by the following steps: 

    Forcing the game to refresh or redraw the problem area.
        Fast Travel out of the area you are having an issue, such as to a nearby planet, and return.
        Enter an "instanced" area where you get a loading screen and return to the area you were experiencing an issue. 
    Waiting 72 in-game hours by sitting down or resting can reset NPC related behavior.
    Sometimes exploring other areas or completing unrelated questlines may resolve issues.
    Load an earlier save from before you zoned into that area and try again.
    Completely exit out of the game and reboot your system.
    Completely disable and remove all mods you have installed, if applicable.
    Verify your game files. Select your platform below for further instructions:
        Steam
        Microsoft Xbox App

We understand the above may not resolve your issue. If you require further assistance, please feel free to reply back to this email and provide any relevant details that are important. Video links and photos are always helpful!

Please note that while Bethesda Customer Support is not able to resolve in-game issues directly, we're happy to collect the information and provide it to the developers for review.

Your feedback is much appreciated and thank you for your patience!

Has been going on for two weeks now. Tried many times to get it to work. Went through all those steps. No mods. Reinstalled. Tried going loading back but after accepting the job and told to go up the elevator, it did it again. Now I am too far into my save for me to just "go back". None of those steps worked.

First, make sure you are connected to the Internet to ensure you have the latest updates to the game. If that doesn't work, proceed to the following troubleshooting solutions:
 
Restart the Game
To restart Starfield:

    Press the [Xbox] button on your controller to return to the Home screen.
    Press the [Menu] button on your controller, select quit and press[A] to close Starfield.
    Select Starfield from the home screen and press [A] to restart.

 
Power Cycle the Console
To power cycle your Xbox:

    Press and hold the [Xbox] button on the front of the console for 10 seconds.
    Unplug the console's power cable and wait for 10 seconds.
    Plug the power cable back in and turn the console back on by pressing the [Xbox] button again.

 
Make sure your Xbox is Well Ventilated
Keep your Xbox as cool as possible to ensure the best performance. To do so, make sure you place your Xbox on a stable surface that is well ventilated, relatively cool, and away from direct heat sources. Do not put other objects on, under, or right next to the console and follow the additional tips:

    Be sure that your console has plenty of clearance on all sides, a minimum of 4-6 inches.
    Do not place your console inside an enclosed cabinet.
    Make sure that none of the console’s vents are blocked or covered.
    Do not place the console or power supply on a bed, sofa, or other soft surface that may block ventilation.
    Do not place the console near any heat source, such as a radiator, heat register, stove, or amplifier.
    Avoid excessively dusty environments, or areas surrounded by airborne debris such as pet hair, which can reduce thermal performance.

 
Delete Local Saves and Re-Sync with the Cloud
Deleting the local saves and re-syncing with the cloud can sometimes correct issues if your game has become corrupted. Make sure you are connected to the Internet and that your saves are synced before proceeding with deletion.
Your saves are stored both on your hard drive and also in the cloud.

    Press the Xbox button    on your controller to open the guide.
    Select My games & apps > See all > Games.
    Highlight Starfield and press the Menu button on your controller.
    Select Manage game and add-ons > Saved data
     Select Delete all to remove the local saves and then follow the prompts
    When you next load the game and are connected to the Internet, your Cloud saves will sync back up.

Full instructions on this can be found on Xbox's support website:  Manage storage on your Xbox console
 
Uninstall and Reinstall the Game
To uninstall a game on your Xbox, follow the steps found here. Be careful to not delete your save files from the cloud.

Once complete, you can reinstall the game from your library or disc.
 
Launch the game Offline
If the above solutions did not resolve it, disconnect your console from the Internet and launch the game.
 
Play Starfield from the Cloud
Play Starfield using cloud gaming, which does require an active Internet connection. You may need to uninstall the downloaded version of Starfield before you can use the Cloud version.
Locate Starfield on your Xbox and look for the Cloud icon and launch from that tile.

 
 If you have any additional issues or questions please don't hesitate to contact us.

Well I don't use an Xbox and like I submitted in my ticket info. I am fully up to date and have tried all the usual trouble shooting steps. No clue why you are now sending me all this Xbox info? Shows you didn't even read the ticket submitted. pathetic. First thing that's asked in the ticket is the platform.

Playing on Steam. Build 12212450 - Happened during previous build as well

Mission is "Back to the Grind - Attend Your Interview at Ryujin Tower. "

Cant Interact with the elevator in the Ryujin Tower to attend the interview or go to any floor.

Verified files and have tried full reinstall multiple times.

Tried to go back a save when it first happened and it repeated itself. Still not allowing the elevator menu to be interacted with. Just makes the click sound and then nothing.


I am at 180 hours into my campaign so for me starting over is a no go. Currently debating on attempting to request refund as this blocks off whole sections of the game. Expecting it to happen more as others in forums are talking about other elevators screwing them over as well.

I avoided those missions for a bit but after updates its still not fixed.

I have had two more elevators not work. One started not working in New Atlantis and forgot where the other one was. Is there a timeline on a fix? This is a game breaking bug stopping quest lines.
